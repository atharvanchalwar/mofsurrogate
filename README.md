This repository is a work in progress towards a surrogate model for Inverse Design of MOFs and currently geared towards high accuracy adsorption property prediction of CO2.
nnmodel.py runs the Neural Network for the prediction of the CO2 vs CH4 adsorption using the already encoded latent vectors.
latent.py and predict.py require the parent VAE model code to run and are only present as representations of the code run to obtain encoded latent space and prediction comparison
